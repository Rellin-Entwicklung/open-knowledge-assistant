# open-knowledge-assistant
a software assistant, which makes you daily complex tasks more easy 

your ideas requested: open-knowledge- assistant

Almost all of us have to perform complex tasks on a daily basis that require knowledge to complete successfully. Often you have to work hard to acquire this knowledge. If you have to do the same task again a few months later, it often starts all over again because you have often forgotten many details.
Examples of activities that could usefully be supported:

* Calibrate / commission electronic device
*	Parameterise frequency inverter
*	Lift service, specification of the procedure and documentation
*	Car / boat maintenance work (inspections incl. documentation)
*	Connecting electronic components with microcomputers
*	Complex image processing (e.g.) portrait retouching

The idea of this project is to divide the completion of complex tasks into small, well-documented steps and then make them available on the screen. 
Each step has a screen page with the following information:

*	Designation (call to action)
*	Optional note text
*	Optional graphic / photo
*	Expected result
*	Optional routine to enter image /measured value
*	Confirm button, saves and displays the next step

During the processing of the individual steps, it is possible to document the success of the step by means of a photo or later, for example, by calling up measured values.
The entire process for a procedure is described in an xml file, which can then be shared very easily in the communities. Once you have created a successful process, other people with less experience and/or knowledge can follow it automatically. 
For the input of the steps, a more comfortable, specific editor is to be developed (see issue), as the creation of the xml files is currently still done manually with standard editors.
The knowledge, now still in the form of xml files, conceivably also as an ontology, should be available locally on the respective computer, as there is often no internet available on construction sites or in drive rooms and similar areas of use.
